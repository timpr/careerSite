# AWE Detail
## Background 

I first joined AWE (Advanced Workstations in Education) during my first co-op (internship) through Drexel University. At the time, the company had 9 other employees and was a computer services company primarily servicing public libraries and Boys and Girls clubs in the region, and they were in the early stages of transitioning into a product company. During that first co-op I helped roll-out the first major deployment of V1 of their new product, the Early Literacy Station (ELS). The ELS is essentially a standalone PC loaded with educational content for young learners and locked down in such a way as to ensure that it is safe, secure, and requires no maintenance. After finishing my first co-op with AWE, I continued to work with the company part-time while I finished my degree. I also spent a second co-op with them.

Joining the company full-time after graduation as a full-time developer, I was part of a very small development team that continued to add new functionality to the product and the supporting portal and web services. I soon became the lead software developer in the organization, and we watched the product line continue to blossom to where our products are in 45% of libraries across the USA, and are in Canada and and several other countries around the world. The company grew to roughly 50 employees, and the development team grew to as many as 8 full-time developers.

- Implemented a custom user interface for managing network connections (both wired and wireless) including troubleshooting capabilities to work around some shortcomings of the provided Windows user interfaces - for our user base
- Integrated a multitude of applications from 3rd party vendors into our products
